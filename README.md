# Computer-Graphics---Steam-Engine
Development of Steam Engine using OpenGL library functions.

<p align="justify">The steam engine was designed using OpenGL functions. The different parts of the engine like the shaft, flywheel, crankwheel, piston and cylinder were designed by writing user-defined functions.
The programming language used was C++. 
Different computer graphics 3D transformation operations like rotation and translation were extensively used to depict assembly level drawing, i.e., assembling individual components that constitute the steam engine together.

The project was developed as part of the 6th semester mini project guidelines prescribed by VTU.</p>
